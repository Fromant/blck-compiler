# Globals ideas

1. Pipeline execution
2. Parallel pipelined execution

# Preprocessor:

- [ ] Fix tests and write new ones
- [ ] preprocessor #if macro + tests
- [ ] preprocessor #else macro + tests
- [ ] all defined words in preprocessor should be changed

# Syntax:

- [ ] parentheses support `~(~a)[]`
- [ ] postfix operators `a++;` `(a++)++;`
- [ ] operator precedence
- [ ] Types check & conversion
- [ ] Check if file contains int main()
- [ ] extern keyword
- [ ] actually call functions
- [ ] some temp built-in call function or `asm()` directive for printf
- [ ] tests

# Backend:

- [ ] asm translation linux support or something
